# Rust hands on

This repo is just a collection of hands-on exercices I did in my Rust learning journey.
These exercices come from many different sources I've ran into. 
From the Rust book, videos, articles to many other random documentation. 
From the very basic 'Hello world' to macros, concurrency,  networking, etc.
