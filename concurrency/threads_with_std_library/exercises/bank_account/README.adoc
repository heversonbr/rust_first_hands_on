= Practice multithreading in Rust

Bank Account with `Arc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`.

== Objective

Simulate a simple bank account system where multiple threads attempt to deposit and withdraw money concurrently. Ensure thread safety using Arc<T> and Mutex<T>.


== Instructions

. Create a shared bank account balance (f64) protected by a Mutex<T>.
. Use an Arc<Mutex<f64>> to share ownership of the account balance across threads.
. Spawn 3 threads that deposit money and 3 threads that withdraw money. Each thread should:
. Lock the mutex.
. Perform the deposit or withdrawal.
. Release the mutex.
. After all threads complete, print the final account balance.

== Constraints

The account balance should not drop below zero. Implement a check before withdrawing money.

== Hint

Ensure that each thread checks the balance before performing a withdrawal to avoid overdrawing.
