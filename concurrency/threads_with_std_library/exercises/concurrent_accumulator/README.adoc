= Practice multithreading in Rust

Concurrent Accumulator with `Arc<T>` and `RwLock<T>`

== Objective

Create a program that allows multiple threads to read from a shared vector of numbers concurrently. Occasionally, one thread should be able to write to the vector, adding a number to it. Use `RwLock<T>` to allow multiple readers or one writer.

== Instructions

. Create a shared Vec<i32> protected by an RwLock<T>.
. Use an Arc<RwLock<Vec<i32>>>> to share ownership of the vector across threads.
. Spawn 5 reader threads. Each reader should:
. Acquire a read lock.
. Print the contents of the vector.
. Release the read lock.
. Spawn 2 writer threads. Each writer should:
. Acquire a write lock.
. Add a number to the vector.
. Release the write lock.
. Ensure that all threads complete.
. Print the final contents of the vector.

== Hint

Use Arc::clone() to pass the Arc<RwLock<Vec<i32>>>> into each thread.
