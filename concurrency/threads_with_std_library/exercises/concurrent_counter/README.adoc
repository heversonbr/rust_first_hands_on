= Practice multithreading in Rust

Concurrent Counter with Arc<T> and Mutex<T>. 

== Objective

Create a program that spawns multiple threads, each of which increments a shared counter. 
Use Arc<T> to share ownership of the counter across threads, 
and Mutex<T> to ensure that only one thread increments the counter at a time.

== Remind
 
- Arc<T>: Thread-safe shared ownership with atomic reference counting.
- Mutex<T>: Mutual exclusion for safe mutable access.



== Instructions

First, try to resolve without these instructions.
Use it only as a hint helper if you need directions.

. Create a shared counter (i32) protected by a Mutex<T>.
. Use an Arc<Mutex<i32>> to share ownership of the counter across multiple threads.
. Spawn 10 threads. Each thread should:
. Lock the mutex.
. Increment the counter by 1.
. Release the mutex.
. Wait for all threads to complete.
. Print the final value of the counter (it should be 10 if each thread increments once).


== Hint
Use Arc::clone() to pass the Arc<Mutex<i32>> into each thread.
