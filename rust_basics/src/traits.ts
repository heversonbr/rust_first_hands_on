// Trait:  "Share behavior"
// A describes an abstract interface that types can implement. 
// This interface consists of associated items, which come in three varieties: functions, types, constants.
// All traits define an implicit type parameter Self that refers to "the type that is implementing this interface". 
// A trait tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and can SHARE with other types, 
// so a trait is a way to define shared behavior in Rust.
// "A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self. 
//  They can access other methods declared in the same trait."
